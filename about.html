            Hey, I'm Abir Sarker, a recent Information Technology graduate from the University of Technology Sydney, majoring in Enterprise Software Development with a sub-major in Cybersecurity and Networking.<br><br>
            With a strong foundation in networking, systems administration, and full-stack development, I enjoy solving practical problems through technology â€” whether that's deploying self-hosted solutions, building secure home infrastructure, or writing clean, efficient code. My experience spans freelance consulting, personal technical projects, and customer-facing roles where precision and reliability mattered.<br><br>
            I'm currently open to graduate opportunities where I can contribute to real-world outcomes while continuing to grow my skills in areas like cloud platforms, system hardening, and infrastructure automation.<br><br>
            Feel free to explore my projects and certifications, and thank you for stopping by!
        </p>

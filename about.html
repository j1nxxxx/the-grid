        <p>Hey, my name is Abir Sarker, and I am a recent graduate from University of Technology Sydney. I hold a Bachelor's of Science in Information Technology with a major in  
            Enterprise Software Development and a sub-major in Cybersecurity and Networking.</p>
        <p>Having recently graduated, I am actively seeking opportunities to apply my 
        knowledge and skills in a professional setting. In the meantime, I am dedicating time to enhancing my 
        expertise by staying updated with industry trends, working on personal projects, and further developing my technical abilities 
         to ensure I am well-prepared for my next role.</p>
        <p>My interests range from working with computer hardware to programming, which will soon be reflected here. Thanks for looking around!</p>
